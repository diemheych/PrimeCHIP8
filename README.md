# PrimeCHIP8
CHIP-8 emulator for the HP Prime in Python
# Installation
Use the HP Connectivity Kit to transfer CHIP8.hpprgm to a virtual or physical HP Prime calculator.

Note: the HP Prime must be running firmware that supports Python (actually MicroPython).
# Keyboard Mapping
The original COSMAC VIP used a 4x4 kex keypad. The mapping of the keypad to the HP Prime keyboard, along with additional keys, is shown below.
# Source
CHIP8.py includes the source code and the PPL wrapper for execution on the HP Prime. The source can be loaded into the HP Connectivity Kit, modified if required, and dragged onto a virtual or physical HP Prime calculator.
